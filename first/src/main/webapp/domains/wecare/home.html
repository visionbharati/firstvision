				We Care <small>We can be there where you cannot but wish for</small>

		<p>There has been a drastic increase in Indians settling abroad
			since the last twenty years. Most of them have successfully
			established themselves in their business and jobs. However having
			their roots in India, only one thing worries them are their parents.
		</p>
		<p>NRI's from India who come to United States, Canada, Australia,
			Germany, Denmark or elsewhere always feel a sense of responsibility
			towards their parents. There is always a feeling of guilt that we
			have left our parents alone, all by themselves in India. Most NRI's
			feel pretty hard to accept the fact that they may not be able to help
			their parents in their old age as previously expected.</p>
		<p>Distance can make it difficult to assess your parent's needs
			and get them the care they deserve.</p>
		<p>We all know that the elderly parents are normally at the mercy
			of the caretaker and being at the mercy of the caretakers these
			elderly people live in a constant state of tension. What affects the
			parents mostly is not the money, but dignity.</p>

		<p>They wish to do so many things for their parents but could not
			because don't know how to go about it. They always remain worried
			about their elderly family members staying here to whom they cannot
			help being at far away distance. They do think that they will give
			all the happiness of their life to their parents but since they don't
			have proper and credible contact in Kolkata, their plans do not
			materialize. Thus the beginning of "VACS" an organization which takes
			pleasure in offering all services related to parental care.</p>

		<p>VB's We Care Service is introducing services to assist you in
			supporting the health and well-being of mom and dad. We understand
			that nothing is better than being in the comfort of home, surrounded
			by family and friends. We can be there, when you can't, to help your
			aging parents live their best lives at home. This team has already
			started extending its horizons and deepening its roots globally with
			the help of NRI's that have accepted the need and the idea. This team
			consists of businessmen, programmers, doctors and House wives who
			would be assisting your parents like their own parents.</p>
