		<p>Every child has a right to a healthy life. But, sadly, majority
			of the children living under the poverty line across our country are
			unable to afford more than one meal a day.</p>
    	<p>
			You can make a difference in the lives of such children through <span
				class=SpellE>VisionBharati's</span> Help Talent sponsorship
			Program.&nbsp;VB's Help Talent works towards improving the lives of
			children and families living in more than 5200 communities across
			India. Our unique Child Sponsorship program has helped many of these
			children rise above their socio-economic challenges.
		</p>
		<p>Your gift of Rs.1000 will ensure that your sponsor child is
			educated, healthy and well-nourished. The child's family and the
			community will also benefit from your contribution.</p>
		<b><p>When you sponsor a child with VB's Help Talent, you will be
			directly supporting a talented child so they can grow up in a loving
			family home.</p></b>
		<p>As a sponsor, you will receive updates about your child, be
			able to write to them, and will see the difference your money is
			making over the years.</p>

		<p>For us, the word 'sponsor' means money is 'supporting' or
			'helping to pay for' the needs of a Talent.</p>
		<p>By sponsoring, you will offer a talent real hope now and in the
			future. Your money will help provide them with a stable childhood in
			a permanent family home, as well as access to healthcare and quality
			education. So when they reach adulthood, they can go on to lead a
			full and independent life.</p>

		<p>Sponsoring a child can be a rewarding experience - for you and
			the children you're helping</p>
		<p>Active Participation:</p>
		<p>You can be an active participant in your sponsor child's growth
